# Messaging Desktop App

This is a Messaging desktop app, written by Shahar and Ze'evi as part of the 'Advenced programming 2' course.

It isn't connected to a server yet, so for now it's a local app.

## Running The App
This app uses React, so it requiers node-js to be installed on your PC.
This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In addition, it contains links to bootstrap and bootstrap icons in it, so they don't have to e installed. There's no need to add any other libraries.

In order to run this app, run `npm install` in the project's directory' and afterward `npm start`.

## Example User
You can see an example user with some chats:

username: example

password: ex01

you can also add more contacts that are hard-coded already( aaa, bbb) and aren't connected to example yet.

## Inside The App
The first screen is a Login screen, and it includes also a link to the Register screen.

After succesful login or register, the app opens the users screen, with a contacts bar and an empty space. Clicking on one of the contacts will open the chat between the user and the chosen contact.

Sending a message is done by typing in the input space below, and pressing Enter or on the Send icon.

Sending media is done by clicking on the Attachment button. and then on the icon of the wanted type of media. (If you want to type again at this stage, click on the Attachment button again, and the input space will be avilable again). Then the user selects the wanted file, and presses the Send button.

You can also record and send the audio by clicking on the microphone icon.

Adding a contact is done by clicing the button on the top of the contacts bar. Searching for a contact is done by typing in the search space.

## have fun!
